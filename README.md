# Black History Quiz

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project, I created a 20 question quiz using python focusing on Black History. The quiz is designed where the participant will know if they got the correct answer immediately after submitting it. Once the participant answers all 20 questions, they will immediately receive their score along with the percent correct.
